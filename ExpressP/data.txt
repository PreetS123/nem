The Congress high command sent Ajay Maken and Mallikarjun Kharge from Delhi to Jaipur with an offer to authorize Sonia Gandhi to decide the CM of Rajasthan, but they could not even hold a meeting of the legislature party there. Failing to persuade the MLAs, Maken and Kharge return to Delhi and hold discussions with Sonia Gandhi, who has asked them to submit a written report. But it is being said that the Gehlot episode is causing a lot of disgrace to the Congress high command.
One Person One Post
It was believed that in the Udaipur session of the Congress, Ashok Gehlot would be made the party president while implementing the proposal of 'one person one post' in the party and the chief minister's chair would be given to Sachin Pilot. But due to the attitude of the pro-Gehlot MLAs, this change does not seem easy at the moment. In fact, in Rajasthan, there has been a tug of war between Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot over the chief minister's chair. Ashok Gehlot does not want to see Pilot occupying his chair at any cost.
